# covid_pipeline
This repository holds my covid data pipeline project

# Purpose
Having completed a data engineering course on coursera, I decided to try my hand at making my first data pipeline to apply what I have learned and get a better understanding of the ETL process

# Tools used
Python to handle to code base 
Json to handle the data extracted from the API 
Pandas to clean the data and create the dataframe 
Airflow to schedule the pipeline
